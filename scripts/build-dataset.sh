#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Common build script for all dataset repositories.
# Called from each dataset's scripts/build.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build.sh                  # build and publish to Queria
#   scripts/build.sh python other.py  # ... with a different build command
#
# There is no target to choose any more. Queria takes the dataset from
# dataset.yml and the account from QUERIA_TOKEN, and the build writes its
# parquet straight into that dataset's own storage.
#
# `sync` is pull, then the build, then push. Starting from what is published is
# what makes the push conditional on it, so two publishers cannot overwrite each
# other. push publishes dbt's artifacts itself, and Queria builds the catalog it
# serves from what push left behind -- neither needs a step here.
#
# To rehearse without publishing, run the dataset against the stand-in in
# queria-cli's tools/ (see its README). fdl's `local` target has no counterpart:
# every write now goes through credentials only Queria can mint.
